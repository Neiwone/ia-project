# Candidate Classification System

This repository contains two versions of a candidate classification system developed using the pair programming technique. One version uses ChatGPT, and the other is a **WIP** (Work in Progress) using a different LLM. The project aims to compare the assistance, suggestions, and performance of each model during development, focusing on their use in programming tasks and automated decision-making.

## Features
- Two versions of the system: one using ChatGPT and the other in progress with a different LLM.
- Focus on candidate classification based on multiple criteria.
- Evaluation of LLMs in assisting with programming and decision-making tasks.
